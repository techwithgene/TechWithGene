I am an Information Technology (IT) graduate looking to now refine my skills to match the current tech landscape in data, security, cloud, and overall technology. While writing this, I am currently working for Hackensack Meridian Health as part of the Digital Technology Services (DTS) support team. I made a career pivot into IT because of my profound interest in technology and dedication to solving contemporary problems. This Github page is being used to document parts of my IT learning journey.

## Objective

My journey in IT has led me to develop skills centered around networking, security, data, and computer information systems as a whole. I am now eager to transition further into the field. At this moment I am currently working on building a scripting/database foundation in Python/SQL.
