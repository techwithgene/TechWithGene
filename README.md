I am a soon to be graduate from Southern New Hampshire University with a Bachelor's in Information Technology (IT) and concentration in Cybersecurity. I made the career piviot into IT because of my profound interest in technology and a dedication to solving contemporary problems.

## Objective

My journey in IT has led me to develop skills centered around networking, cybersecurity, and computer information systems as a whole. I am now eager to transition into the field and build an IT foundation, whether it be starting at help desk or anything beyond. I have ambitions to refine a wide skillset which includes scripting (Python/Bash).
